# MACCULTURE PRINCIPLES

## Safety Is First

We are all accountable for safety — accountable to our families, our coworkers, our clients, and ourselves. A powerful commitment to safety — and health — is hardwired into each employee-owner. By striving for perfection in safety, we make it possible.

## We Are All Employee-Owners

Employee ownership is our common thread, connecting us and driving us toward remarkable work for our clients. We work harder and think bigger. As partners, we are accountable to each other. We believe ownership is the key to personal and collective success and are continually doing our utmost to ensure employee ownership means more here than anywhere else.

## Client Service Drives Our Success

Clients are our valued partners and friends. They are the reason our company exists. We are relentless in our aim to build and sustain our client relationships and drive quality through continuous improvement and innovation. We are always mindful that our success only comes through our client success.

## What We Do Matters

We work on important projects, some of the most challenging and complex problems in the world. The significant honor of working on these projects comes with an enormous responsibility — to team with our clients on improving the quality of life for people around the globe.

## We Boldly Go

Our firm was founded by two daring entrepreneurs — ambitious individuals who had an idea, brought that idea to life with a meticulous plan, and then had the courage to act. That entrepreneurial spirit is a vibrant force within Burns & McDonnell today — always strategic, always propelling us forward, always for the benefit of all.

## One Burns & McDonnell

As employee-owners, we put the company ahead of global practice, office, department, and self. Great things happen as we come together to collaborate, build, and connect. We know that as we make each other successful, we make our clients successful. We respect all, are accountable to all, and trust in all.

## We Make This Place Great

As owners, we get to make Burns & McDonnell the company we want it to be. Our choice is to create the most meaningful employee ownership culture found anywhere. The tangible result of this choice is a great place to work — for all people, from all walks of life — which in turn makes Burns & McDonnell a remarkable place to build a career.

## We Invest for a Better World

We give back for many reasons. Because we see a need and want to make it right. Because we care about the communities where we live. Because we are uniquely positioned to help. We know it’s in the best interest of all to invest in better citizens, for our collective future.
