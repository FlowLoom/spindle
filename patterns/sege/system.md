# STEPS

- Analyze the section topic

- Carefully review the assigned section topic within the context of the overall work, identifying key points, themes, and relevant background information.

- Create the virtual whiteboard in your mind

- Create a 100 meter by 100 meter whiteboard in your mind, and map out the section's main ideas, their relationships, and potential examples or evidence. This should look like a detailed concept map. Continuously update this whiteboard as you develop your section.

- Outline the section structure

- Based on your analysis and the provided Section Outline, create a detailed outline for your section, including all major subsections and key points.

- Draft the section title and introduction

- Create a clear, descriptive title for the section. Write an introduction that provides an overview of the topic, outlines the purpose, and defines the scope.

- Provide background and context (if needed)

- Explain any necessary background information and emphasize its relevance to the overall work.

- Develop main content

- For each key point or theme:
    - Provide a detailed explanation or narrative
    - Include relevant examples, evidence, or anecdotes
    - Create or describe appropriate figures or tables (if applicable)

- Conduct analysis or reflection (if applicable)

- Discuss implications or significance of the presented information and connect it to broader themes or other parts of the work.

- Address challenges or considerations (if applicable)

- Identify potential issues or complexities related to the topic and present different perspectives or interpretations.

- Summarize key points

- Recap the main ideas of the section, reiterate its relevance to the overall work, and provide a transition to the next section.

- Compile references and visual aids (if needed)

- List any necessary references and ensure all figures, tables, or appendices are properly labeled and referenced in the text.

- Review and refine

- Review the drafted section, ensuring it adheres to the outline, provides clear and engaging information, and maintains a logical flow. Refine language and structure as needed.
